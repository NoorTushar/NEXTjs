### 游릵 Folders and Files Structure

Let us recall first how the react routing worked:

Similarly in NEXTjs,

游늯 layout.js - main route element

<img src='./Attachments/Pasted image 20240616113105.png'>

游늯 page.js - this is the children element of main.js

### 游릵 Routing

游릴 For the common layout design like navbar, you have to write code inside the 游늯 layout.js file.

游릴 Let us create routes for `about` , `services` and `contact` page.

### 游릵 Navigation

游릴 one of the ways is to use `Link` from nextjs. This is like an anchor tag with href as its props.

游릴 show different style for active route

游릴 another way to route is to use `useRouter()`

### 游릵 Nested Navigation

Simply create folders inside.

### 游릵 Dynamic Routing

游릴 Purpose: If we click on a card view details button, it should redirect us to a page with that ID/ slug and show data accordingly.

<img src='./Attachments/Pasted image 20240616193142.png'>

游릴 then we should create a subfolder named `[id]` inside the `blogs` folder

<img src='./Attachments/Pasted image 20240616193308.png'>

here we should be getting `params` in which we will have the `id` as our subfolder name is `[id]`
